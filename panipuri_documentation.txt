in 200 revolution stepper motor is making jerking while begenining of steps and end of the steps ,
at lower accelaratino value such as in between 300 t0 800 the vibration of stepper motor even becoming more
tried with speed of the stepper motor too,but we can notice some jerking at beginenig and at the end.

Steps Calculation

LRG - for puri catcher proximity sensor
---------------------------------------

puri_catcher_home_sensor = A0;
Sensor Name:- SN-04P 
Working :- When Obstacle Detected It Will Send The Logic 1
	   if the obstcle not detected it will send logic 0

Wiring Diagram  Brown ---> VCC  
		Blue  ---> GND
		Black ---> Signal

Operating voltage --> 10v to 30v ,but 5v connected here to the main motherboard because of 5v logic and its working.
