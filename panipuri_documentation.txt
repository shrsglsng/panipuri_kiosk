in 200 revolution stepper motor is making jerking while begenining of steps and end of the steps ,
at lower accelaratino value such as in between 300 t0 800 the vibration of stepper motor even becoming more
tried with speed of the stepper motor too,but we can notice some jerking at beginenig and at the end.

Steps Calculation

LRG - for puri catcher proximity sensor
---------------------------------------

puri_catcher_home_sensor = A0;
Sensor Name:- SN-04P 
Working :- When Obstacle Detected It Will Send The Logic 1
	   if the obstcle not detected it will send logic 0

Wiring Diagram  Brown ---> VCC  
		Blue  ---> GND
		Black ---> Signal

Operating voltage --> 10v to 30v ,but 5v connected here to the main motherboard because of 5v logic and its working.


LRC - IR Sensor for detection of Puri
--------------------------------------

IR = A1;
Sensor Name :- Keltronix
Working :- When Obstacle Detected It Will Send The Logic 0
	   if the obstcle not detected it will send logic 1

Wiring Diagram  Brown ---> VCC
		Blue  ---> GND
		Black ---> Signal (NO) here NO connection where we are using
		White ---> signal (NC)

Operating voltage --> 10v to 30v ,but 5v connected here to the main motherboard because of 5v logic and its working.


LRP - Conveyor home position inductive proximity sensor
-------------------------------------------------------

conveyor_hmp=A2; 

Sensor Name:- SN-04P 
Working :- When Obstacle Detected It Will Send The Logic 1
	   if the obstcle not detected it will send logic 0

Wiring Diagram  Brown ---> VCC  
		Blue  ---> GND
		Black ---> Signal

Operating voltage --> 10v to 30v ,but 5v connected here to the main motherboard because of 5v logic and its working.


NEN  - Puri opener Stepper motor
--------------------------------

pul+=45;         //puri_catcher_step
dir+=44;	//puri_catcher_dir
pul- , dir- ,ena- ==gnd
ENA+ not connected optional,according to chatgpt no need
switch config for tb6600 stepper driver- 2 , 4, 5 -> ON
					 1 , 3, 6 -> OFF
					 rated current -> 1.5A
					 Revolution -> 1600
					 Voltage Rating ->9V to 42V D.C

					 Model number :-RMCS 1010
					 Wiring Color Code:-    Yellow ---> A+
								Blue   ---> A-
								Red    ---> B+
								Green  ---> B-

Note:-This stepper motor is moving backward(anti clockwise) when the connections are proper,if we want to move forward
(clockwise) in the coding give -3000 steps( - ) symbol or else change the wiring pattern such as connect B+ and B- into 
the A+ and A- vice-versa . 

LIS - puri holder opener inductive proximity sensor
---------------------------------------------------

cat_hmp=A3; 

Sensor Name:- SN-04N 
Working :- When Obstacle Detected It Will Send The Logic 0
	   if the obstcle not detected it will send logic 1

Wiring Diagram  Brown ---> VCC  
		Blue  ---> GND
		Black ---> Signal

Operating voltage --> 10v to 30v ,but 5v connected here to the main motherboard because of 5v logic and its working.
